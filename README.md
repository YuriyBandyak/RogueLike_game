# RogueLike_game
My example is a roguelike game in the old style, ie in the console. 
Inspired by games like Rogue and NetHack.

The goal of the game: go through ten levels.
All elements in the game appear randomly, except for the initial items and the number of enemies in the level.
The higher the level - the more enemies on the level. But this also applies to items whose level increases relative to the level of the room.
The fighting system as in the old games: several options to choose from (attack enemy, block attack, use a potion and try to run away).
In main menu are help tab, where is described symbols and some game rules.

Mainly used structure for player, enemy, items and rooms.
The playing field was implemented using char array.
All elements in the game appear randomly, except for the initial items and the number of enemies in the level.
